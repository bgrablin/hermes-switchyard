# Changelog

## 0.3.2

- Ships as a root-layout native Hermes plugin with `plugin.yaml` and a root `register(ctx)` entrypoint.
- Provides `jev_skill_select`, `jev_model_route`, and the Windows-only `jev_computer_use` pilot.
- Requires `public_or_sanitized_data_ack: true` before model-facing operations; this remains a caller attestation, not DLP or authorization.
- Keeps endpoint, model aliases, provider fallback behavior, action budgets, hotkey allowlists, and target re-capture checks closed in code.
- Returns advisory selections and `completion_candidate` results without loading skills, changing the runtime model, or certifying GUI completion.
- Verifies behavior with offline synthetic transports, dispatch fixtures, portability checks, and a source-bounded release archive.
